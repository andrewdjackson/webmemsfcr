			<p>
			Any reported sensor fault will cause the ECU to run the engine in limp mode and likely cause over fueling. Do not make any adjustments until the sensor fault is fixed.
			</p>
			<h4>Action Plan</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Clear the faults</li>
				<li>Switch off ignition</li>
				<li>Switch on ignition and check the fault codes again</li>
				<li>If the faults persist or after driving the car they reappear, replace the sensor / check the relevant circuit</li>

			<p>
				The oxygen monitoring system (O2 System) is critical to the fuel mixture determined by the ECU. The system relies on a working Lambda Sensor (O2 Sensor).<br>
				When the ignition is switched on, the ECU Lambda relay is energised to enable the Lambda Sensor heater. A failure in the lambda heater or the circuit will delay the start of the lambda oscillating and a failure in the O2 System.<br>
				After approximately 90 seconds the Lambda Sensor should start rapidly oscillating between 100mv and 900mV.
				The ECU expects this behaviour, <strong>if the lambda voltage is a static or oscillations are slow, the ECU will determine a failure in the O2 System.</strong>
				If the lambda is working correctly, the ECU will enter Closed Loop mode where it uses the lambda readings to adjust the fueling accordingly.
			</p>
			<h4>A Working O2 System</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Lambda Voltage oscillates rapidly between 100mV and 900mV after 90s of start</li>
				<li>O2 System  Status is Active (O2 Lambda Status = 1) after 90s of start</li>
				<li>Loop is Closed (Closed Loop = 1)</li>
				<li>Lambda Heater relay is working, this can be tested</li>

				The ECU will react to conditions based on the values it reads from the sensors fitted to the engine. The following details the behaviour and expected values.

			<h4>Ignition is ON, Engine not Running</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Engine RPM 0</li>
				<li>MAP 100kPa (this is atmospheric pressure, e.g. no vacuum)</li>
				<li>Air Intake Temperature at general air temperature e.g 20C</li>
				<li>Lambda Voltage 435mV, not oscillating</li>
				<li>O2 System (Lambda Status) is Inactive (0)</li>
				<li>Loop is Open (Closed Loop = 0)</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Ignition is ON, Engine COLD : Running and Idle</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Engine RPM 1200 </li>
				<li>MAP 40kPa or less (lower is better)</li>
				<li>Coolant Temperature of a static 60C indicates a possible fault</li>
				<li>Air Intake Temperature at general air temperature e.g 20C</li>
				<li>Lambda Voltage starts oscillating after 90 seconds</li>
				<li>O2 System (Lambda Status) is Active (1) after 90 seconds</li>
