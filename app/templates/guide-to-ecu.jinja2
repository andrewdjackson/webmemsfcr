				<h5>The Rover Modular Engine Management System (MEMS) ECU</h5>
				<p>
					The Rover MEMS ECU is a sophisticated engine management system.
					It's principle role is to create the most optimised air / fuel mixture for the engine given the current conditions.
					To do this the ECU needs to know the load and environmental conditions that it uses in the complex air / fuel ratio (AFR) calculation.

							The early SPI (pre-1993) is fitted with the Rover MEMS 1.3, this ECU is distinguishable from later versions as it has 2 connectors.
							This ECU does not support O2 System information.

							Later SPI's are fitted with the Rover MEMS ECU 1.6.
							This version of the ECU has a single connector and provides additional data for management of the O2 System / Closed-loop operation.
